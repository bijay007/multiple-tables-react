** **
### Prerequisite:
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/es/) (v8 or higher)
- `https://github.com/bijay007/multiple-tables-react.git` :point_left: Clone from here
    

### How to run this project:

-   **Install dependencies**  `npm install` 

-   **Build and Serve** `npm run start`

*The app will be served from a local dev server by default* - [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)
    

### Things TODO in future:

-   *Stream JSON from backend instead of reading files in front*
-   *Refresh data fetch using timer in backend*
-   *Add custom CSS to break the bigger column into smaller ones*
-   *Add colorful icons to make the controls and feature status more visual*

### Furthur steps to enhance the app:

-   *Add an additional timer in front to detect and show any delay (network latency) that might happen and inform the user.*
